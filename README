This is the project for some tools for daily training.

## dictate num 

It will read some numbers and you should dictate it. 
The level means how long the number you listen. 
Every exec will be saved in the save file, and when you correct 3 times, it will increase the number length, and when you do wrong 3 times, it will decrease number lens.

[ TIPS: 2016-12-06 ]
The first goal to me is dictate 20 long numbers, and I want to reach the goals in three months. 
In order to got it , I need to exec 50 times one day. 
At the start, I can remember 9-10 numbers at one time.
